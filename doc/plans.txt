PLANS FOR ONYX

Make a rhythm game
  currently have a demo of drum gameplay engine, with basic 3d (GL) graphics
  using SDL audio at the moment. should maybe move to OpenAL (easier mixing and volume control of many channels, easier to hook up to `conduit-audio` reliably)
Improvements to conversion tool
  Single song view: loads a song, displays all imported info (editable), full control over what is included in export target
  More control over which transform passes are applied to song data
Preview tool
  Likely going to move from the web app to a desktop (SDL) app
    Too difficult to track browser issues, especially relating to audio and the local (file://) execution method
  Should redo song formats to use a single tree-map that indexes track states
    Currently stuff like pro keys is very inefficient bc each key has its own tree-map
  Want to turn it into a live preview app for authoring
    Would monitor a .RPP or .mid file for changes and reload data automatically
    Reaper can run a script that reports play position and state to a local web server, so seeking and playing would all be synced with the preview
  Minor thing, but image drawing should all be tweaked so it takes the center point as its argument
    Important for moving all sizes to the config file
Code maintenance / general stuff
  Should redo all record naming to be focused towards lenses (with `generic-lens`)
  Parsed note track types should contain note on/off, not the `Maybe len`
Extension to new games
  Dance Dance Revolution / Stepmania / Phase Shift Dance mode
  Donkey Konga
  Taiko no Tatsujin
  Rocksmith
