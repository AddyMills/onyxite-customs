PLANS FOR NEW AUDIO I/O SYSTEM

audio inputs:
- expressions (or nothing) for each part, and for backing
  - adding sequencing support, but this just evaluates to an expression
- mogg/vgs file

audio outputs:
- rb mogg
  - can be any number of channels (but each part must have at least 1)
  - drums must be a valid mix layout
  - silent part can be mono except drums which must be stereo
- magma wavs
- ps/ch oggs: should end exactly at [end]
  - silent parts should have no file
- gh2 vgs: should end just past [end]
  - silent part can be mono
- audio for web preview app
  - stereo ogg/mp3 with everything in it
  - end time doesn't matter
- playing audio via sdl/openal
