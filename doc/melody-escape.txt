song length in ticks is an integer. The number of ticks is:
  ceiling( (length in seconds) * (44100 / 1024) )
so there are 43.06640625 ticks per second.
song length in seconds is a decimal, to two decimal places (rounded down?)
bpm is an integer
confidence:
1 no stable 4/4 tempo detected (energy peaks)
2 acceptable
3 good
4 excellent

TRANSITION FORMAT
X:{posn}-Y:{posn} is a transition from state X to state Y
where posns are in ticks (integers)
L low (walking)
N normal (jogging)
H high (running)
E extra high? (flying)
Autogenerated transition length is 42 ticks for adjacent states, 64 for H to L (usually). Also seen: 31 for H to E, 42 for E to L, 42 for L to H, 31 for E to H
To start in neutral state, start with the transition L:1-N:44 (note, 43 ticks)

Intensity transitions need to be free of notes, including the transition edges.
A note simultaneous with the start of the next state will not appear.

EVENT FORMAT
not sustained: {posn}:X
sustained    : {posn}:X-{duration}

values of X for color (non-obstacle) arrows:
8 up
6 right
4 left
2 down

values of X for obstacle arrows:
U up
R right
L left
D down
A: dramatic/cutscene up (long pause in song)

Held colors are broken outside of Walking - the hold line is invisible but it still requires you to hold them
Dramatic up is only available on Running - on other intensities it turns into a normal U
On Flying, non-sustained obstacle arrows turn into colors
On Walking, all obstacle arrows turn into colors
