HOW DEFAULT SLIDE DIRECTION IS DETERMINED

Isolated sustain note, nothing before or after:
0-7 up
8+ down
This uses the left-most string to determine.
So 68xxxx slides up, 86xxxx slides down.
Even if the left-most string is an arpeggio ghost note (ch2) or muted (ch4) its fret still applies here.

Sustain note (1 beat) followed by a HOPO (16th gap):
Slide connects to the HOPO, and goes the correct way.
If same fret, slide goes down.

Sustain note (1 beat) followed by a strum (16th gap):
Slide does not connect, but still goes the correct way.

If the gap is even a tick over a 16th note (120 ticks),
neither correct-slide nor connection happens and you get the "isolated note" case above.

The "correct way" behavior doesn't care if the two notes aren't on the same string.
However the connecting behavior does need them to have the same strings.

"Short slides" (slide on a non-sustain note) can only be done on a note
followed immediately (16th I think?) by a hopo on exactly the same strings.
Even 8th triplet (160 ticks) doesn't work.

Tremolo

These are verified to work; they let you strum much slower than notated.
They just don't visually show lanes.

RANDOM NOTES

a chord with frets 2 and 15 (hand position 2) is ok.
2 and 16 (hand position 2) fails magma.
ERROR: MIDI Compiler: /users/mtolly/protar-test/gen/target/rb3/magma/notes.mid (PART REAL_GUITAR): File: e:\prj\rbn\system\src\beatmatch\GameGem.cpp Line: 532 Error: fret < 16

1 and 15 is also bad.
