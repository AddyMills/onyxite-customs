A bug was observed where a fill that ended a 8th triplet or 16th triplet before
the measure line wouldn't cover a simultaneous drum note correctly.
After experimentation, I've determined that the end of a fill will always be
rounded to the nearest 64th note (30 ticks).
The following table shows the behavior of various distances in ticks between
a fill end (with simultaneous notes) and the end of a 4/4 measure.
Note that Magma attempts to prevent the buggy behavior, but it only does so
if your fill is between 1 and 8 ticks from the closest 64th note.

numbers are the number of ticks from the end of the measure
120 = 1/16 note
160 = 1/8 note triplet
early means glowing green note comes before the notes it should cover up
late means glowing green note comes after the notes it should cover up
