Finalized .RBA format specification:

All values Little Endian
Header
Offset      Length      Meaning
0x00        0x04        "RBSF" Magic
0x04        0x04        Version = 0x03
files=0x07;
0x08        0x04*files  Offset into file of files
0x24        0x04*files  Filesize
0x40        0x14*files  SHA1 hash of each file
0xCC        0x14        SHA1 hash of header
0xE0        ?           Sequence of 8 null-termined strings

Explanation of the SHA1 Header hash (0xCC, 0x14 bytes)...
First, write the entire header with this hash section zeroed out, including the string list, which brings you right up to the first file offset. The hash of this then gets retroactively placed at 0xCC as the header hash.
