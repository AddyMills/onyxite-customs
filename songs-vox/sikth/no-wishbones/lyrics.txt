Be aware!
Circles of despair
Quickly, quickly try and run

Corner kings
The corner kings they come
Their hordes of fear
Their eyes are near

Weeping wounds, weeping wounds, wounds
You gotta try and run
Get out now

Corner kings
The corner kings they come
Their hordes of fear
Their eyes are near
No questions asked

All alone
Open palms
They tell you it's got to be this way
This way

Dusty paths by a canvas roof
Waiting for rain
The devil in him, the peril in you
Waiting for rainfall

Interlinked, silver palmed and armed
Aloof, aloof alliances
No wishbones, no wishbones, no home
This darkness in which such evil seed are sown
Gun men come, show them who's in charge
Secret servants of the golden palm

Corner kings
The corner kings they come
Their hordes of fear
Their eyes are near
Looking through tinted glass

All alone
Open palms
They tell you it's got to be this way
This way

All alone
Open palms
They tell you it's always been this way
This way

Dusty paths by a canvas roof
Waiting for rain
The devil in him, the peril in you
Waiting for rainfall

When you look into their eyes
Waiting for rain
Too empty to even cry
The rain never fell

Looking through tinted glass
Those broken eyed vessels
Lost in repetition
From the day they saw dawn
No questions asked
They just carry on

Fear can turn those tears into gold
The puppeteers
Art of manipulation
Pockets full of gold
Art of manipulation
Is what they sold

Lies! Darkness! Pure evil! Vile!
Yeah they're drinking Cholera in their water
While they try to stay alive
â€˜Cause there ain't enough water in the well
See my reflection
But who am I to say?
A spectator, just like you!
A commentator, just like you!

Why?
