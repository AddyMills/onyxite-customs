  comments:
  - Parts 1 and 2 from RBN glued together by Onyxite.
  - Target `rb3` is almost pristine,
    with only one change (to work around the RB3 discobeat bug).
  - Targets `rb3-2x` and `ps`, in addition to 2x kicks,
    use my edited drums chart with some ghost notes and missing notes added.
