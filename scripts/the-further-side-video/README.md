From the album chart release of The Further Side (Nova Collective),
this is the script used to generate the [Clone Hero + Rock Band 3 Pro videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6CMAksrnz4&list=PLbzRUhk5--qejXeY_xklTb3nwbuoQHguj),
and also the GIMP project for the title cards.

Settings used for the source videos:

  * CH is guitar-keys(tap)-bass, note speed 7

  * RB3 is PG-PD-PK-PB, turn BNS on, start song, don't restart because that increases track speed
