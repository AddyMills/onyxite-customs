From the album chart release of Train of Thought (Dream Theater),
these are the REAPER project files that performed the final audio processing.

  1. Generate `song` and `drums` audio from Onyx (no `drums` for Vacant)

  2. For all but Vacant, use iZotope RX7's debleed function on `song` to remove bleed from `drums`, with 0.3 reduction strength, 1.5 artifact smoothing

  3. Provide `riffs-vacantending.mp3` from the Jordan Rudess Online Conservatory
