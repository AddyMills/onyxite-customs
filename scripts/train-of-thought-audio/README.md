From the album chart release of Train of Thought (Dream Theater),
these are the REAPER project files that perform the final audio processing.

  1. For all but Vacant, generate `song` and `drums` audio from Onyx

  2. For Vacant, provide album track, plus `riffs-vacantending.mp3` from the Jordan Rudess Online Conservatory
