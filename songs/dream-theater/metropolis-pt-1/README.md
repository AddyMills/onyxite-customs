## Dream Theater

Instruments:

  * (Pro) Drums
  * Bass
  * Guitar

Supported audio:

  * `album` (Images and Words)

  * `jammit`

Notes:

  * Chart confidence: *high* (Jammit stems).

  * I made the ending into a BRE, even though it is really only necessary for drums. The rolls would be a tremendous pain otherwise, especially the initial kick drum since there is no kick drum roll lane in RB3.
