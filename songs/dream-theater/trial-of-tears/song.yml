    Chart confidence: *high* (Jammit stems).

    Soundscapes in the intro and outro are awful to play/chart. I did my best!

    For the "loose discobeat" in the first verse, I charted it as straight 16ths.
    This is how both Portnoy and Mangini play it live,
    and anything else would just be frustrating to play in RB.
