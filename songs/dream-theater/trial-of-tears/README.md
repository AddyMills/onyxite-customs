# Trial of Tears

## Dream Theater

Instruments:

  * (Pro) Drums

Supported audio:

  * `album` (Falling into Infinity)

  * `jammit`

Notes:

  * Chart confidence: *high* (Jammit stems).

  * Soundscapes in the intro and outro are awful to play/chart. I did my best!

  * For the "loose discobeat" in the first verse, I charted it as straight 16ths. This is how both Portnoy and Mangini play it live, and anything else would just be frustrating to play in RB.
