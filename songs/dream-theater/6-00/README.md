## Dream Theater

Instruments:

  * (Pro) Drums
  * Vocals (3)

Supported audio:

  * `album` (Awake)

  * `jammit`

Notes:

  * Chart confidence: *high* (Jammit stems).

  * The quiet section after the keyboard solo has some overdubbed drum parts. I tried to merge the two parts into a coherent whole, as is done on Harmonix tracks like Frankenstein.
