PRO KEYS

(Note: range markers are not showing up for me so I'll give suggestions on ranges, although you probably did it right).

This chart generally looks pretty good. Hard to hear some of the rhythm of the chords but you got the chords right so I trust you on what you heard in terms of rhythm.

The big thing here is the wrapping on the riff at measure 8 and places like it. I think one of two things: either the C should be moved down to reflect the octave change of the whole
F-E-C, or move the F and E notes up. Should be consistent. If you were to move the F-E notes up, make it all D range. If you move the C note down, then shift back and forth between
C range and D range each measure.

I'm assuming the 1st chorus is entirely in A range until the transition at measure 42, when it switches to D range.

Measure 70 should start F range.

Measure 88 sustain should probably be extended to keep consistency with the rest of the sustains.

DRUMS

I think the YGs in the choruses should be blue cymbals? Esp. the ones that come out of fills.
* DONE - the double crashes are clever editing in dvd I think

44.4 - I don't hear a flam.
* DONE

51.1 and 51.2 sound like the same cymbal hits. Perhaps both YGs?
* Nope, they are different I think

80.3 sounds like a snare flam.
* Nope, it's a snare and cymbal

88.3 - I hear a crash instead of a hi-hat.
* Does this mean 88.1? If so DONE

110.1 - Not sure if the YG flows here.
* DONE

GUITAR

For the second measure of the main riffs, do it this way instead? https://gyazo.com/899dafd1a403eb0a039bf06b9f98bbce
* I think the way I did it is closer to the tab book - wasn't sure what to do with the 2nd to last note since it's actually a chord (but open/muted), but the notes before it are good

BASS

I feel like the main riff sections should be all strums. It matches the guitar's all strums too.

I think guitar and bass's last notes should end at the same time.
* DONE
