Supported audio:

  * `album` (Images and Words)
  * `jammit`

Notes:

  * Chart confidence: *high* (Jammit stems).

  * During the break, there's a note played by the bass where all other
    instruments cut out in the `album` and `jammit` audio. The Greatest Hit
    remaster (possibly to be supported) has drums during this part.
