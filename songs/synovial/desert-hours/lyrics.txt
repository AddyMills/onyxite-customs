Incoming.
Transmission.
From the far reaches of my mind.
There it sits.

Concrete.
Locked into position and pushing all things out its way.
What is a measly obligation but a chore to the force that’s boring a hole.
And that faces me, staring into these dead eyes, this dead cell.
That would otherwise be rotting away.
Get a grip. Come alive. Come awake.

There is a beacon in the distance. (Screaming at me).
Calling out my name. (Tugging at my neck).
Paving the way. (Paving the way).
For all the things that may come to me.

I suddenly rise. What is the time?
And it dulls my nerves but it’s clouding my senses.
It opens up my eyes to all of the voids I could be filling.
Makes me weak. Makes me ache.
So much that anything I can imagine is functional.
And any light I can draw is sublime.

There is a beacon in the distance.
Calling out my name.
(Rushing my blood, taking control).
Paving the way. (Paving the way).
For all the things that may come to me.
In the dead of night.

Now it possesses my heart.
What's the harm in a call to motion?
What does it matter the form that the focus comes?
(The form that the focus comes).
I crest. Open. Electrified. And shaking.
It’s a terrible sign. It must be.
What has this done to me?

It makes me feel alive when nothing, lately, seems to be working.
Don’t fight it.
What is the harm in losing yourself in something?
Just a little. Just a little. Just a little. More.

I pull from anywhere I need to.

To feel alive again.

More.
In the dead of night.
I wait for the call.
To infect me again.

These parallels are power lines now.
