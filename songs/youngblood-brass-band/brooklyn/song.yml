    The drums are performed by 2 or 3 percussionists,
    so I did my best to arrange it into a playable drumkit part.
    Ghost notes are everywhere and they are often difficult to make out in the mix,
    so there may be some small errors but nothing major.

    Bass is tuba, keys is trombone plus backing chords, guitar is sax plus backing chords.

    All instruments have overdrive/unison.
