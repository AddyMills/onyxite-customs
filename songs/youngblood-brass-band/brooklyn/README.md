Supported audio:

  * `album` (center:level:roar)

Notes:

  * The drums are performed by 2 or 3 percussionists, so I did my best to arrange it into a playable drumkit part. Ghost notes are everywhere and they are often difficult to make out in the mix, so there may be some small errors but nothing major.

  * Bass is tuba, keys is trombone plus backing chords, guitar is sax plus backing chords.

  * All instruments have overdrive/unison.
