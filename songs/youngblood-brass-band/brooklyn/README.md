## Youngblood Brass Band

Instruments:

  * (Pro) Drums [(preview)](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~tolly/customs/?title=brooklyn&artist=youngblood-brass-band)

Supported audio:

  * `album` (center:level:roar)

Notes:

  * Chart confidence: *medium-high*.

  * This song is performed by 2 or 3 percussionists, so I did my best to arrange it into a playable drumkit part. Ghost notes are everywhere and they are often difficult to make out in the mix, so there may be some small errors but nothing major.
