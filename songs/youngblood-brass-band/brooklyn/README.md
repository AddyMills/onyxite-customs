Supported audio:

  * `album` (center:level:roar)

Notes:

  * Chart confidence: *medium*. This song is performed by 2 or 3 percussionists,
    so I did my best to arrange it into a playable drumkit part. Ghost notes are
    everywhere and they are often difficult to make out in the mix, so there may
    be some small errors but nothing major.
