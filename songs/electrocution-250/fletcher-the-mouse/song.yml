    loading-phrase: 'According to YouTube, this was originally charted in May 2011.
      Surprisingly enough, not many notes have changed at all since then: the main
      updates actually lie in audio, tempo map, forcing modernisation and a very few
      extra instruments.'

# TODO tempo map is adjusted, need to now fix guitar (keys) timing at end
