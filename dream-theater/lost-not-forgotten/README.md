# Lost Not Forgotten

## Dream Theater

Instruments:

  * (Pro) Drums: Expert

Supported audio:

  * `album` (A Dramatic Turn of Events)

Notes:

  * Chart confidence: *medium-low*.

    * No isolated audio.
    * Mangini's drum parts can be somewhat obtuse, and the fills are often
      designed for his "pyramid" tom layout.
    * ADTOE's mixing makes the drums very muddy/quiet compared to other albums.
