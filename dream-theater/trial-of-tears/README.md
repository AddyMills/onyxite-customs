# Trial of Tears

## Dream Theater

Instruments:

  * (Pro) Drums: Expert

Supported audio:

  * `jammit`

Supported drum pedals:

  * `2p`

Notes:

  * Chart confidence: *just below high*.

    * Charted to Jammit stems.
    * Soundscapes in the intro and outro are awful to play/chart. I did my best.
    * The "loose discobeat" in the first verse, I charted as straight
      16ths. This is how Portnoy and Mangini play it live, and anything else
      would just be frustrating to play in RB.
