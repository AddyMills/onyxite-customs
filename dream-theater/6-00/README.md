## Dream Theater

Instruments:

  * (Pro) Drums: Expert

Supported audio:

  * `album` (Awake)
  * `jammit`

Supported drum pedals:

  * `1p`
  * `2p`

Notes:

  * Chart confidence: *high* (Jammit stems).

  * The quiet section after the keyboard solo has some overdubbed drum parts.
    I tried to merge the two parts into a coherent whole, as is done on Harmonix
    tracks like Frankenstein.
