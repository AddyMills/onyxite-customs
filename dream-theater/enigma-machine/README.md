# Enigma Machine

## Dream Theater

Instruments:

  * (Pro) Drums: Expert

Supported audio:

  * `album` (Dream Theater)

Supported drum pedals:

  * `1p`
  * `2p`

Notes:

  * Chart confidence: *medium*. The drum solo is designed for Mangini's unique
    tom layout, so I used the RB3 `[mix _ drums0dnoflip]` event to move snare
    to the yellow pad, and wrote all left-hand tom hits as red.
